## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate BezierKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, add it to your target in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'BezierKit', '>= 0.16.2'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.
Once you have your Swift package set up, adding BezierKit as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "<Your Target Name>",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/hfutrell/BezierKit.git", from: "0.16.2"),
    ]
)
```

## Usage

### Constructing & Drawing Curves

BezierKit supports cubic Bezier curves (`CubicCurve`) and quadratic Bezier curves (`QuadraticCurve`) as well as line segments (`LineSegment`) each of which adopts the `BezierCurve` protocol that encompasses most API functionality.

```swift
import BezierKit

let curve = CubicCurve(
    p0: CGPoint(x: 100, y: 25),
    p1: CGPoint(x: 10, y: 90),
    p2: CGPoint(x: 110, y: 100),
    p3: CGPoint(x: 150, y: 195)
 )
 
 let context: CGContext = ...       // your graphics context here
 Draw.drawSkeleton(context, curve)  // draws visual representation of curve control points
 Draw.drawCurve(context, curve)     // draws the curve itself
```

### Intersecting Curves

The `intersections(with curve: BezierCurve) -> [Intersection]` method determines each intersection between `self` and `curve` as an array of `Intersection` objects. Each intersection has two fields: `t1` represents the t-value for `self` at the intersection while `t2` represents the t-value for `curve` at the intersection. You can use the `point(at:)` method on either of the curves to calculate the coordinates of the intersection by passing in the corresponding t-value for the curve.

Cubic curves may self-intersect which can be determined by calling the `selfIntersections()` method.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hfutrell/BezierKit/master/images/usage-intersects.png" width="256" height="256">

```swift
let intersections: [Intersection] = curve1.intersections(with: curve2)
let points: [CGPoint] = intersections.map { curve1.point(at: $0.t1) }

Draw.drawCurve(context, curve: curve1)
Draw.drawCurve(context, curve: curve2)
for p in points {
    Draw.drawPoint(context, origin: p)
}
```

### Splitting Curves

The `split(from:, to:)` method produces a subcurve over a given range of t-values. The `split(at:)` method can be used to produce a left subcurve and right subcurve created by splitting across a single t-value.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hfutrell/BezierKit/master/images/usage-split.png" width="256" height="256">

```swift
Draw.setColor(context, color: Draw.lightGrey)
Draw.drawSkeleton(context, curve: curve)
Draw.drawCurve(context, curve: curve)
let subcurve = curve.split(from: 0.25, to: 0.75) // or try (leftCurve, rightCurve) = curve.split(at:)
Draw.setColor(context, color: Draw.red)
Draw.drawCurve(context, curve: subcurve)
Draw.drawCircle(context, center: curve.point(at: 0.25), radius: 3)
Draw.drawCircle(context, center: curve.point(at: 0.75), radius: 3)
```

### Determining Bounding Boxes

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hfutrell/BezierKit/master/images/usage-bounding-box.png" width="256" height="256">

```swift
let boundingBox = curve.boundingBox
Draw.drawSkeleton(context, curve: curve)
Draw.drawCurve(context, curve: curve)
Draw.setColor(context, color: Draw.pinkish)
Draw.drawBoundingBox(context, boundingBox: curve.boundingBox)
```
